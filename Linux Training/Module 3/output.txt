Q1) to demonstrate that the script accepting 3 arguments

this is the source directory -> ./source_directory
this is the backup directory -> ./backup_directory
this is the file extension of files to be backed up ->.txt

Q2) to find the matched extension files with globbing
 
files found :
sample1.txt
sample2.txt
sample3.txt

Q3) environment variables to track the number of files and total backup size
 
env var -BACKUP_COUNT to keep track of no.of backed up files before backup = 0
env var -size_files to keep track of size of backed up files before backup = 0
 
Q4) Print the names of these files along with their sizes before performing the backup
 
./source_directory/sample1.txt 607 bytes 
./source_directory/sample2.txt 2859 bytes 
./source_directory/sample3.txt 3541 bytes 

Q5) i) if the backup directory does not exist, create it. If creation fails, exit with an error

backup directory exists

Q5) ii) if the source directory is empty or contains no files matching the extension, exit with a message.

the source directory is non-empty and has 9 total files and 3 matching files

Q5) iii)  If a file already exists in the backup directory with the same name, only overwrite it if it is older than the source file (compare timestamps). 

starting backup ....

backing up ./source_directory/sample1.txt to ./backup_directory/sample1.txt ....
both time-stamps of sample2.txt are equal ... skipping backup
both time-stamps of sample3.txt are equal ... skipping backup

Q)6) OUTPUT REPORT
